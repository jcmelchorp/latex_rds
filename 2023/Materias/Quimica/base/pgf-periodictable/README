This is pgf-PeriodicTable, version 2.0.0 (2023/02/20).

The purpose of this package is to provide the Periodic Table of Elements in
a simple way. It relies on pgf/TikZ to offer a full or partial periodic table with
a variety of options and displaying the desired data for all the 118
elements. It can be done in six languages: English, French, German,
Portuguese (from Portugal and from Brazil), Spanish and Italian.

Just typeset \pgfPT to get a Periodic Table of Elements or \pgfPT[<options list>]
to do it at your custom way.
